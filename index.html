                    <h4 class="mt-4">Seeking a Greater Challenge</h4>
                    <p>I've had the opportunity to work at both a fast-paced startup and a top fintech company (HSBC). The startup experience taught me how to build products from the ground up with limited resources, while HSBC exposed me to large-scale systems in a structured corporate environment. Now, I believe I'm ready for an even greater challenge—one where I can contribute to applications that serve millions of users worldwide. Amazon provides the perfect opportunity to build impactful products at scale and create a positive influence on society through technology.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="mt-4">Inspired by the People at Amazon</h4>
                    <p>I also have extraordinary friends working at Amazon. They are highly capable yet humble (Yan youfu), always pushing themselves to improve while fostering a collaborative environment. Their experiences have shown me that Amazon values excellence, innovation, and teamwork, and I would love the opportunity to work alongside talented engineers like them—learning from the best while also contributing my own expertise.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mt-4 lead">That's why I'm excited about joining Amazon—to take on new challenges, collaborate with brilliant minds, and contribute to a platform that shapes the digital world.</p>

                <h3>Apologizing for Overlooking a Senior Engineer's Role in the Agile Workflow</h3>
                <p><strong>Situation</strong>: At TVCBOOK, I was responsible for building and implementing an Agile development workflow to improve project tracking and efficiency. As part of this process, I onboarded engineers and introduced sprint tracking to measure individual contributions. However, I overlooked involving one of the senior DevOps engineers in the discussion, and as a result, the workflow did not fully reflect his contributions, making him feel undervalued in the new system.</p>
                <p><strong>Task</strong>: I needed to acknowledge my mistake, apologize for the oversight, and adjust the workflow to fairly represent all team members' contributions, including DevOps work that might not directly tie to sprint stories but was critical to the project's success.</p>
                <p><strong>Action</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scheduled a one-on-one conversation with the DevOps engineer</li>
                    <li>Apologized directly for not properly considering his role</li>

                <p><strong>Situation</strong>: As a Research Assistant leading a team of 5 in my professor's lab, we collaborated with a Texas-based power station company to automate and enhance their workflow, including a project management dashboard and some reports generation. During a meeting, the company's manager proposed developing a report generation program.</p>
                <p><strong>Task</strong>: My responsibility was to evaluate the feasibility and impact of the proposed task to ensure we prioritized high-value solutions. After a detailed walkthrough, I realized that while the task was technically achievable, it was not very cost-effective from my opinion. It would take a team of 4 from our lab and the company working for months to develop the program, yet in the end, it would only save one person about a week of manual work each year.</p>
                <p><strong>Action</strong>:</p>
                <ul>

Over time, as the number of users grew, we started receiving several customer requests simultaneously, including feature enhancements, bug reports, and performance issues. Given the limited resources, we couldn't address everything at once, so I had to determine how to prioritize competing requests effectively.</p>

                <h3>Communicating a Change in Direction: Adjusting Backend Architecture for Maintainability</h3>
                <p><strong>Situation</strong>: At HSBC, I was working on a client contact information dashboard. Initially, the plan was to reuse an existing backend service built by another team, as our manager believed it would save development time. However, after analyzing the service, I found that it was overly complex for our needs and would be difficult to maintain in the long run. I realized that building a lightweight backend from scratch would be a better solution, but I anticipated resistance from my manager and teammates, who were focused on delivering within tight deadlines.</p>
                <p><strong>Task</strong>: My goal was to convince my manager and team that developing a simplified backend was the better long-term approach, while also addressing concerns about project timelines and workload.</p>
                <p><strong>Action</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prepared a clear comparison documenting the differences between reusing the existing system vs. building a new one</li>
                    <li>Highlighted the maintenance challenges, unnecessary complexity, and long-term risks of using the existing service</li>
                    <li>Addressed concerns proactively, acknowledging the team's focus on deadlines</li>
                    <li>Demonstrated how building a lightweight backend would still meet the schedule while ensuring future scalability</li>
                    <li>Framed the discussion around business impact, emphasizing reduced future maintenance costs</li>
                    <li>Proposed a compromise to balance efficiency and time constraints by reusing some components while refactoring others</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Result</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Manager agreed to the new approach after seeing the clear benefits in maintainability and scalability</li>
                    <li>Despite spending slightly more time on initial development, saved effort in future development and debugging</li>
                    <li>Final system was more stable, easier to maintain, and better aligned with project needs</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Delivering a Harsh Truth: Addressing a Junior Engineer's Incomplete Work</h3>
                <p><strong>Situation</strong>: While leading a team of five in my professor's lab, we were developing a dashboard web application for a company. One of the junior engineers was struggling with his frontend tasks, repeatedly submitting incomplete and buggy implementations. Despite multiple reviews and feedback, the same issues kept occurring, and it became clear that his lack of understanding was slowing down the entire project.</p>
                <p><strong>Task</strong>: I needed to have a direct conversation with him to address the issue honestly, ensure that he understood the expectations, and help him improve without demotivating him.</p>
                <p><strong>Action</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scheduled a private 1:1 meeting to create a safe space for open discussion</li>
                    <li>Provided clear, objective feedback about specific mistakes and their impact on the team</li>
                    <li>Acknowledged his efforts but emphasized expectations: "I see that you're trying, but the quality isn't at the level we need"</li>
                    <li>Offered guidance through a structured learning approach:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Smaller, focused tasks for step-by-step learning</li>
                            <li>Pair programming with a more experienced teammate</li>
                            <li>Recommended frontend learning resources for his weak areas</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Set clear expectations for ownership of learning and testing code before submission</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Result</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>He acknowledged the issue and became more receptive to feedback</li>
                    <li>Over time, his frontend skills improved with fewer buggy implementations</li>
                    <li>The project stayed on track with his more effective contributions</li>
                    <li>Team dynamic strengthened through a culture of open but constructive feedback</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="key-learning"><strong>Key Learning</strong>: Delivering harsh truths is necessary for growth, but should be done with respect, empathy, and a solution-oriented mindset. Balancing honest feedback with clear support helps struggling teammates improve while keeping projects on schedule.</p>
